<h2 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

I am [available for hire](https://cedricchee.com/2020/04/21/hire-cedric-chee/). I'm looking for a way to transfer my full stack web development expertise, backend development, and engineering skills to a role within a technology company.

- [experiments](https://github.com/cedrickchee/experiments), a collection of code snippets

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning writing, communication skills, and meditation.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development, JavaScript, Go, "boring" technology :smile:, etc.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me or tweet me at [cedric_chee](https://twitter.com/cedric_chee).

âš¡ Fun fact: The highest I've ever been: climbed [Mount Kinabalu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kinabalu) in one day.
